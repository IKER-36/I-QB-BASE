# ABOUT THIS PROJECT 👀
Hello, welcome to our project to make the first base qb-core full Spanish and public! 👥
The goal is to create a free database with the new qb-core free for everyone!
This is our community in which we work in general on various frameworks apart from qb like esx.

# HOW TO COLLABORATE 🧏‍♂️
First you must download the base and install it (soon a tutorial to do so).
To upload changes on translations or suggestions, it will be done through "pull request", I myself will approve the changes, reviewing them beforehand so as not to load the project.
